I'm a pediatrician at CUMC, specializing in critical care medicine. I work in the pediatric intensive care unit and also perform clinical research. Specifically I study the long-term outcomes of children after they recover from relatively common critical illnesses, such as severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
